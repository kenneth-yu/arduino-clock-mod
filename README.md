# arduino-clock-mod

I started this project because I bought a digital clock that had 5 dimmer settings. When I left it on a setting that was bright enough to see during the day time, it was way too bright. When I left it on a dimmer setting that was acceptable at night, it wasn't visible during the day. 

After doing some research I figured out that hooking up the clock to an Arduino could potentially solve my problem. Through tons of google and a handy multimeter, I was able to get the clock to auto change via the light sensor reading.
